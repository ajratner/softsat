Researching ways to handle 'hard' (deterministic, near-deterministic) constraints within the context of probabilistic inference- especially focused on templated factor graphs.  Looking into extensions of [MC-SAT][mcsat] algorithm and others.

## Usage
Get dependencies with `sh dependencies.sh`.

Build with `ant`.

Then run with `java -ea -jar softsat.jar`.
